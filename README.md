# Fullerton-Housing-

# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the housing market in Fullerton, California, through the application of statistical models to predict housing prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, lot size, year built, days on the market, and homeowners association fees. The analysis utilizes linear and ridge regression models to understand the influence of these factors on housing prices and to evaluate the predictive performance of these models.

# Data Source

The dataset, FullertonHousing (2).csv, includes listings from the Fullerton housing market, encompassing various attributes of the houses along with their prices. This data is crucial for building and evaluating our models.

# Methodology
Data Preparation: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed. Missing values are imputed using mean imputation for simplicity, ensuring that the models can be trained on a complete dataset.

Modeling:
A linear regression model is initially fitted to identify the relationship between the house characteristics and their prices.
A ridge regression model is then applied to account for multicollinearity and overfitting, with the optimal penalty term (lambda) determined through cross-validation.

# Instructions for Use

Environment Setup: Ensure that R and RStudio are installed on your system. Install the tidyverse, glmnet, and mice packages if they are not already installed.
Running the Analysis: Open the R Markdown file and run each code chunk sequentially. The dataset path may need to be adjusted according to your directory structure.
Viewing Results: The final HTML document generated by knitting the R Markdown file will include detailed results and visualizations.

# Dependencies

R and RStudio
Packages: tidyverse, glmnet, mice, ggplot2
