# Fullerton-Housing-

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the housing market in Fullerton, California, through the application of statistical models to predict housing prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, lot size, year built, days on the market, and homeowners association fees. The analysis utilizes linear and ridge regression models to understand the influence of these factors on housing prices and to evaluate the predictive performance of these models.
